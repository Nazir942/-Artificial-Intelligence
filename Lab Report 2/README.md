Title: 
Iterative deepening depth-first search (IDDFS)

Problem Statement: 
Develop a Python program using Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) to check if a path exists between two points in a grid maze. The grid contains walkable spaces and walls, and movement is allowed in four directions.

Objective: 
Implemented the IDDFS algorithm in a grid maze and determine the existence of a valid path using memory-efficient depth-limited searches.
