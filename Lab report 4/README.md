Title: 
Modified K-Means Clustering Using Manhattan Distance and 2D Text Visualization.

Introduction:
In this lab, we implemented a modified K-Means clustering algorithm using Python. Instead of
the traditional Euclidean distance, we used Manhattan distance to calculate the proximity
between data points and cluster centers. A dataset of 100 random Cartesian points and 10
random initial cluster centers was generated. The clustered data was visualized as a 2D matrix
printed with print(), using different symbols to represent points and centers.

problem Statement:
Write a lab report on the implementation of a modified K-Means clustering algorithm using
Python. In this task, you must generate a data file containing 100 Cartesian points P(x, y) and 10
initial cluster centers C(x, y). The algorithm should be rewritten to use the Manhattan distance
method for calculating distances between points and clusters. Additionally, you are required to
create a 2D visualization of the clustered data using a matrix, where each cell represents a
coordinate on the plane and displays either a data point or a cluster center using distinct symbols.
This visualization must be displayed using only the print() function.
